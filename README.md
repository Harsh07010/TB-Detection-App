This application is designed to assist in the early detection of Pulmonary Tuberculosis (TB) using two complementary diagnostic approaches:

Symptom-Based Prediction ‚Äì A machine learning model trained on textual symptom data to predict TB likelihood based on user-inputted symptoms.

Chest X-ray Image Classification ‚Äì A deep learning model based on CNN architecture (e.g., ResNet or MobileNetV2) that analyzes uploaded chest X-ray images to classify them as Normal or TB-infected.

üîç Key Features
Dual Model Integration: Supports both clinical symptom input and chest X-ray analysis for improved diagnostic support.

User Authentication: Secure Sign Up / Sign In system for personalized access.

Real-Time Prediction: Fast and responsive interface for instant results.

Mobile-Friendly Interface: Accessible from desktop and mobile browsers.

‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used
Python, Flask

TensorFlow / Keras for deep learning

Scikit-learn for symptom-based model

OpenCV and Matplotlib for image processing

HTML/CSS/JavaScript for frontend
